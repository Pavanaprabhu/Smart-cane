 “Humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment, our technologies, is broken and disabled. We the people
 need not accept our limitations, but can transfer disability through technological Innovation”. These were not just words but he lived 
 his life to them, today he uses Prosthetic legs and claims to live to normal life. So yes, technology can indeed neutralize human 
 disability; with this in mind let us use the power of Arduino and simple sensors to build a Blind man’s stick that could perform more
 than just a stick for visually impaired persons.
